# ADR-005: GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project needed a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, security scanning, dependency management, and deployment. We required a system that would ensure code quality, security, and reliability while supporting modern development workflows with feature branches and pull requests.

## Decision
Implement a multi-workflow GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with separate workflows for different concerns: continuous integration, deployment, security scanning, and dependency management.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **GitLab CI**: Use GitLab's built-in CI/CD
   - Pro: Integrated with GitLab, powerful pipeline features
   - Con: Requires GitLab, different ecosystem

2. **Jenkins**: Self-hosted CI/CD solution
   - Pro: Highly customizable, extensive plugin ecosystem
   - Con: Requires infrastructure management, complexity

3. **CircleCI**: Cloud-based CI/CD platform
   - Pro: Fast performance, good Docker support
   - Con: Additional service dependency, cost considerations

4. **Vercel**: Platform-specific deployment
   - Pro: Optimized for frontend deployments
   - Con: Limited CI features, vendor lock-in

5. **Single workflow**: Everything in one GitHub Actions workflow
   - Pro: Simpler configuration
   - Con: Slower execution, harder to maintain, less flexible

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Native GitHub integration**: Seamless integration with repository
- **Parallel execution**: Multiple workflows can run simultaneously
- **Separation of concerns**: Each workflow has a specific purpose
- **Branch-based triggers**: Different workflows for different branch patterns
- **Security integration**: Built-in security scanning and secret management
- **Cost-effective**: Free for public repositories, reasonable pricing for private
- **Extensive ecosystem**: Large marketplace of actions

### Negative
- **Vendor lock-in**: Tied to GitHub platform
- **Learning curve**: Need to understand GitHub Actions syntax
- **Debugging complexity**: Multiple workflows can be harder to debug

### Neutral
- **YAML configuration**: Uses YAML syntax for workflow definition
- **Marketplace dependency**: Relies on third-party actions

## Implementation
Created four specialized workflows:

### 1. CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
**Triggers**: Push to `develop`, PRs to `main`/`develop`
**Purpose**: Continuous integration testing
```yaml
- Multi-node testing (Node.js 20 & 22)
- Biome linting and formatting
- TypeScript type checking
- Build verification
- Security audit (pnpm audit)
- Conventional commit validation (PR only)
```

### 2. Deploy Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
**Triggers**: Push to `main`, manual dispatch
**Purpose**: Production deployment
```yaml
- Environment variable setup
- Dependency caching with pnpm
- Code quality checks
- Build generation
- Sanity Studio deployment
```

### 3. Security Workflow (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)
**Triggers**: Push, PRs, daily schedule
**Purpose**: Security analysis
```yaml
- CodeQL static analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Security report generation
```

### 4. Dependencies Workflow (`.github/workflows/update-deps.yml`)
**Triggers**: Weekly schedule, manual dispatch
**Purpose**: Automated dependency management
```yaml
- Dependency updates
- Automated testing after updates
- Pull request creation for updates
```

## Key Features
1. **pnpm Optimization**:
   - Proper pnpm store caching
   - Frozen lockfile installation
   - No npm cache conflicts

2. **Environment Management**:
   - Secrets for sensitive data
   - Variables for configuration
   - Environment-specific settings

3. **Quality Gates**:
   - All checks must pass before merge
   - Automated code quality enforcement
   - Security scanning integration

4. **Automation**:
   - Automated dependency updates
   - Conventional commit validation
   - Automated deployment on main

## Configuration Requirements
### Repository Secrets
- `SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN`: Deployment authentication

### Repository Variables
- `SANITY_STUDIO_DATASET`: Target dataset
- `SANITY_STUDIO_API_VERSION`: API version (optional)
- `SANITY_STUDIO_BASE_PATH`: Base path (optional)
